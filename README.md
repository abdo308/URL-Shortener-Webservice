## ðŸ“– Explanation
Long URLs are often difficult to share, remember, or include in text messages, emails, and social media posts. A **URL Shortener** solves this problem by generating a unique identifier (short code) that maps to the original URL.  

When a user enters a long URL:
1. The system generates a short, unique key (e.g., `abc123`).  
2. The key is stored in the database with its corresponding long URL.  
3. A shortened link is created (e.g., `https://short.ly/abc123`).  
4. When users visit the shortened link, the service looks up the key and redirects them to the original URL.
